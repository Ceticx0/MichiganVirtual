PMR:

    +: I think implementing subclasses is very inuitive in Java, and this assignment was quick to write and test

    -: I initally had the name of the class I was extending wrong, but realized my mistake quickly, however I'm suprised my IDE didn't point out the error.
    
In the Future: I think polymorism will be a helpful tool for writing things more efficiently.
