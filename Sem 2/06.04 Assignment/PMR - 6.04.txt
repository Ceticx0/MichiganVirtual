PMR:

    +: I had no trouble with the major content in this lesson, iterating with the shorter for loop syntax is nice, and arrays of objects are helpful to use.

    -: I had some trouble figuring out how to best format the output, and I'm still not entirely happy with it.

In the Future: I think using arrays of objects to make code shorter will be a valuble skill
