PMR:

    +: I think arraylists are nice to use and can be very versitile compared to regular arrays, I'm confident in using them

    -: It took me multiple attempts to get the string formatting correctly, and I initally forgot the units. 

In the Future: I would like to use more arraylists to more easily store data variably.
