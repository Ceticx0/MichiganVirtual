PMR:

    +: I think its kind of interesting to see how certain chatbots work, and I found it fun to rack my brain trying to figure out what the professor could be doing behind the scenes.

    -: This lesson took me a long time to complete, and I felt some of it was repetitive, however I eventually understood all of the content covered.

In the Future: I'd like to learn about more complex NLP techniques, especially those with machine learning involved.
