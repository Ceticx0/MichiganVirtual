PMR:

    +: Similar to last time, once I had the inital algorithm down, it was easy to extend it to sort by the two other things.

    -: Although selection sort was a bit easier to implement, I think, it still took a lot of thinking to get the algorithm down.

In the Future: I want to try and implement bubble sort, because I heard that's a common interview question.
