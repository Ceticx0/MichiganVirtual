PMR:

    +: I was able to effectively use the things I've learned to create this program relatively quickly.

    -: While having many different sorting methods that do almost the same thing seems slightly repetitve, I wasn't sure a good way to fix it.
    
In the Future: I'd like to see if I can make a function to sort by any part of a list of objects.
