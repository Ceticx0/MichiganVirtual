PMR:

    +: I think binary search algorithms are very interesting and potentially very useful, and I'd love to keep using them.

    -: This assignment took me some time, as I was slightly confused by some of the instructions, however the example binary search code helped

In the Future: I would like to learn about some use cases for binary searching algorithms.
