PMR:

    +: Recursion is an inuitive way to solve this problem, and it was simple to implement.

    -: This program runs quite slow for larger numbers, because the recursive approach calculates many numbers over and over again, which is unnessesary and non preformant.
    
In the Future: I'd like to learn more efficient ways of calculating fibonacci numbers.
