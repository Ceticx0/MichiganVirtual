PMR:

    +: I had no trouble implenenting and using all of the traversal methods used in this class. 

    -: Almost nothing went particularly poorly, I really think I understand all the material very well.

In the Future: I think I could make use of all traversal algorithms reliably, and format output easier and faster than previously.
