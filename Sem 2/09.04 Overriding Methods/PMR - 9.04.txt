PMR:

    +: Overridng methods is inuitive in Java and I didn't struggle with it.

    -: I was a bit confused about the class extensions to make at first and how many dimensions they should have.
    
In the Future: I expect Overloaded methods will be useful especially in cases of equality and toString.
