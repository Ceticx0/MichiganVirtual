PMR:

    +: Almost all concepts I was required to use I seem to understand well, this assignment didn't take as long as I thought it might've.

    -: The biggest time sink in this assignment was cleanly displaying the output, however I am figuring out how to do it more effectively and efficently, and I'm happy with the result.

In the Future: I think I'll be able to format output quicker and easier with the experience I gained from this project.
