PMR:

    +: None of the base logic was challenging and I dont think I'll have any issues with if-else-if in the future.

    -: I got the logic for rouding the outputted strings wrong a few times, I am confident I can do it now, however I think it's a bit verbose and annoying to change.

In the Future: I'd like to learn to use String.format to round numbers easier.
