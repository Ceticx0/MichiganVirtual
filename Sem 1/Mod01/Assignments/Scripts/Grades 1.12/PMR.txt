PMR:

    +: After completion I throughly understand the way Java does type casting for integer and double variables and how to use the increment operator (++)

    -: I spent a long time confused about how do calculate the average and why it wasn't working. I went though multiple incorrect designs like ```average = ((average * numTests-1) + testGrade) / (double)numTests;```

In the Future: I now can use a accumulative average in my programs which I previously didn't know, and I now know what I should be manually typecasting when working with doubles and integers.
