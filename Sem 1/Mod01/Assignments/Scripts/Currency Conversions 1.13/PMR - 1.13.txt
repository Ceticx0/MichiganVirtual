PMR:

    +: The currency coversion and first souvenir budgeting wasn't a challenge, and I think I executed it nicely.

    -: I was initally confused at the calculation for total items too, and had to try a few different ways of typecasting before getting the correct result.

In the Future: In the Future: I would make the program more versatile by allowing the user to input various places and items they would go to and buy instead of making the program so fixed.
