PMR:

    +: I had a chance to try multiple different Java enviorments, and I settled on two that I enjoy
    and am now comfortable with.

    -: I initally had print statements for all the information, but they weren't organized very well so I had to go back
    and add dividers + a banner.

In the Future: I'll start with the dividers and organization so that I can keep things organized as I write the
project instead of having to go back
