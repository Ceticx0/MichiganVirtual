PMR:

    +: By now, I really have no issue defining and using static methods, and I completed the progam relatively quickly.

    -: It's a bit annoying and tedious to format output using \t, it took me multiple attempts to make everything aligned.

In the Future: I'd like to learn more advanced usage of String.format that allows you to format text easier by specifing a length.
