PMR:

    +: I found the parsing of the strings relatively straightforward and am confident that I can use it in the future effectively.

    -: Initally my scan.nextLine(); on line 20 was not waiting for input, I found out that it was because it was eating the \n from the previous input, which .nex() doesn't

In the Future: I will know how to prevent Scanner.nextLine() method from absorbing unwanted characters instead of waiting for input.
