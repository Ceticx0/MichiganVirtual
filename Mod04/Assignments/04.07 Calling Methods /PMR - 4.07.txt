PMR:

    +: Defining and calling static methods is not complicated, I implemented that aspect first try and will be confident with them in the future. 

    -: Implementing all the program logic perfectly took me a long process of debugging various issues that arose. I had a few errors in some of my functions and had to try various different things for step 4 since the instructions were ambigous.
    
In the Future: I'd like to find more elegant ways to do certain functions in this program, and leave less room for small errors.
