PMR:

    +: I learned how to write to files and am confident I could use them in the future in different and similar ways.

    -: I initally strugged to come up with the control flow for this program, and made a few smaller mistakes like mistaking == and .equals 

In the Future: I am confident I can write to files in the future and I know more about validating inputs, however I would like to learn how to write binary data like to databases or java object.
