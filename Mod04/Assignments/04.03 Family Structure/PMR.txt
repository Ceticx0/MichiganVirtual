PMR:

    +: Scanning from the file itself is very similar to reading input, so it wasn't challenging to implement the core counting logic of the program.

    -: I had a bit of trouble setting up the file scanner object initally. First I forgot to create the file object for the scanner to refrence, and then I forgot to specify the error my class can return.

In the Future: I want to understand when and why I use 'throws' when defining a class, and what exceptions I might want to put there.
