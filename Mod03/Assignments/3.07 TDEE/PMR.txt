PMR:

    +: The logical operators and utilizing string methods for comparisons is all understandable and I'm confident I could use them next time I need them.

    -: I was a bit confused on how to go about getting the activity factor from the menu at first, and I'm not happy with my solution. I think using multiple lists or hashmaps would be better than so many if else statements in the future.

In the Future: I'd like to learn a more readable, expandable and shorter way to get an activity factor from the menu or other problems like it, perhaps using a hashmap.
