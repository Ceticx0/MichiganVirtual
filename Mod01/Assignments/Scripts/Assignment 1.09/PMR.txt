PMR:

    +: Had no issues comprehending the concepts covered however occasionally made syntax errors.

    -: I took a long time to write all of the concatenated print statements and made a few errors in writing them that needed to be corrected after.

In the Future: I'd learn how to use formatted strings to write the print statements a little faster and avoid potentional errors in slow rewriting.
