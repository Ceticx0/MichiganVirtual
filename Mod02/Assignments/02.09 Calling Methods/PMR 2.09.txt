PMR:

    +: I was already decently familiar with methods in java, and understood all the concepts in this lesson and assignment.

    -: I didn't initally realize the divison method was not a void method and didn't understand the last prompt momentarily, I realized my mistake quickly however

In the Future: I should read or glance through the methods I'm going to be using or at least their inputs and return types.
