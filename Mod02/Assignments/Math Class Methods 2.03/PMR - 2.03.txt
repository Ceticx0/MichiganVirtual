PMR:

    +: I understoof how and why the Math class utilizes static methods to make calculation easier.

    -: I initally wasn't sure of the order of operators for type casting, and had to test it, and I initally had the range of my random function incorrect, but fixed it.

In the Future: I think using Math.pow is a bit combersome each time you want to raise something to the power of 2, I know many languages have a shorthand operator like **, id like to learn Java's if it has one
